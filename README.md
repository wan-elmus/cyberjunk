Write a script that downloads all hyperlinked .pdf files it finds at a user-provided URL.
Compulsory steps and or requirements:
▪ Call the script getpdf.sh.
▪ The user is to be prompted for the URL
▪ If there are no hyperlinked .pdf files at the URL provided, the user to be informed of this and the 
script exited with an appropriate exit code
▪ All .pdf files downloaded from the URL provided are to be stored in a directory with a unique name 
that does not conflict with any other directories that exist or which may be created in the future
▪ It is the responsibility of the script to handle directory naming and creation; not the user’s
▪ Once all .pdf files have been downloaded from the URL provided, the user is to be informed of how 
many were downloaded, and the directory into which they were downloaded
▪ The user is also to be provided with a tabulated summary of each downloaded .pdf file name and its
size on disk in bytes, kilobytes or megabytes as applicable
▪ Your script is also to accommodate an optional -z option (to be used at the command line) that, 
when used, will facilitate the adding of all the downloaded .pdf files to a zip archive that is to reside 
in the same directory as the downloaded .pdf files and given the same name as the directory in 
which the .pdf files are stored.
▪ If the user provides an invalid flag at the command line, they are to be informed of this with an 
appropriate error message and the script terminated with an appropriate exit code 
▪ To construct your script, use any combination of commands, utilities and programmatic techniques 
covered through Modules 1-8 inclusive. Be aware - use of commands, utilities and programmatic 
techniques not addressed in the unit’s content materials may be considered a red flag for academic 
misconduct.
▪ Any files and/or folders created by your script in the course of its execution are to be removed upon 
the script’s termination. Note: There will be a one (1) mark deduction from your achieved score if any
files and/or folders created by your script are left behind on the assessor’s machine at the conclusion 
of the marking process.
▪ Your script must contain concise and germane ‘in-situ’ comments that explain all of the code 
elements it contains. Be aware – comments that are not germane to the code they describe, or a 
complete lack of comments, may both be considered red flags for academic misconduct.
▪ The efficiency with which the commands, utilities and programmatic techniques have been utilised 
within your script will form part of your mark, with the total lines-of-code it contains not to exceed 
90, including comments. If you exceed this limit, marks will be deducted based on the magnitude of 
this excess.
